<h1><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This privacy policy governs your use of the software application </span><strong>Conquer Der Die Das</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (&ldquo;Application&rdquo;) for mobile devices that was created by </span><strong>Jasmin Grbo</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Application is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an educational app for memorizing German articles and learning new nouns.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>User Provided Information</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only piece of information that the Application may possibly collect from you is your age. If provided this information is being encrypted and stored in a local database on the device itself. The sole purpose of collecting this information is to adapt ads that are being served to the user&rsquo;s age. You may opt out and not provide this information. By opting out the Application closes itself, since this information is essential to the Application.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No information is being collected automatically by the Application itself except of the information of whether the device is connected to the internet or not. If the internet connection is not available, the app closes itself since without internet ads cannot be served. See <strong>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</strong> for more information.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Application does not collect precise nor any kind of information about the location of your mobile device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, your only information (age) is not being shared with anyone.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We keep this Application free by serving ads. In order to serve ads the active internet connection is needed. The Application is checking for the active internet connection, this information is not being saved anywhere and is used solely for the purpose of deciding whether the Application should continue to run or the Application should close itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are the resident of the EEA (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">European Economic Area) and 16+ years old, you may opt in to have ads being tailored to you (personalized-ads) by having our partners collecting and using the data about you and having and using unique identifier on your device. The Application itself is not having the access nor is it using by any means any kind of that data. You may read our partners Privacy Policies for the details on how the data is being collected and used. There'll be a button to click for each of our partners that leads to their Privacy Policies.
If you opt out from this then we'll partner with Google and use a unique identifier on your device to respect your choice and serve non-personalized ads.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two opt-out options for users of this Application:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will retain your age data if provided for as long as you use the Application.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Children</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she may uninstall the app itself, because the information is only being kept in the device itself.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. Your age is not being saved as a plain text but it&rsquo;s being encrypted prior to saving. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information you provide, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Changes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy and informing you via the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what&rsquo;s new in this release on Google Play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. This Privacy Policy can be found both in the settings of the Application as well as on the website: <strong>https://jasmingrbo.github.io/privacy_policy</strong>. The Privacy Policy on the website is being updated more often, but we'll try to keep the both synchronized.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Your Consent</strong></h2>
